These scripts can be placed or linked (i.e. ln -s download-video
/usr/local/bin/download-video) to one of your PATH directories.

It works and was tested with the fork of [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]] called [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]]. The latter
has additional features and is actively maintained/updated.

Have fun!
