These scripts can be placed or linked (i.e. ln -s download-video
/usr/local/bin/download-video) to one of your PATH directories.

It works and was tested with the fork of [[https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl][youtube-dl]] called [[https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp][yt-dlp]]. The latter
has additional features and is actively maintained/updated.

Additionally, if you want to add more flags/options when calling any of the
scripts, you can do it like the following (assuming the list has say 60+ videos):
#+begin_src shell
download-list https://some.awesome.list.com --playlist-start 53 --playlist-end 60
#+end_src

Another way to specify items exolicitly to download from a playlist is the following (assuming it has 31 items or more):
#+begin_src shell
download-list https://some.awesome.list.com --playlist-items 31,27
#+end_src

And so on... Have fun!
